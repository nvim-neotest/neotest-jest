# neotest-jest

> [!NOTE]
> As the [main repository](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest-jest) appears
> to be unmaintained, this branch serves as the "bleeding-edge" by continuously
> merging open pull requests from the main repo. Note that this repo is not
> intended to supersede the main repo in any way but makes it easier to have
> fixes and new features available.

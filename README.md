# neotest-jest

[![build](https://github.com/haydenmeade/neotest-jest/actions/workflows/workflow.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/haydenmeade/neotest-jest/actions/workflows/workflow.yaml)

This plugin provides a jest adapter for the [Neotest](https://github.com/rcarriga/neotest) framework.
**It is currently a work in progress**. It will be transferred to the official neotest organisation (once it's been created).

## Installation

Using packer:

```lua
use({
  'rcarriga/neotest',
  requires = {
    ...,
    'haydenmeade/neotest-jest',
  }
  config = function()
    require('neotest').setup({
      ...,
      adapters = {
        require('neotest-jest')({
          jestCommand = "npm test --",
          jestConfigFile = "custom.jest.config.ts",
          env = { CI = true },
        }),
      }
    })
  end
})
```

## Usage
